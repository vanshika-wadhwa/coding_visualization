        <h2>What is a Stack?</h2>
        <p>
            In computer science, a <strong>Stack</strong> is a linear data structure that follows a specific order for 
            managing elements, known as the <strong>LIFO</strong> principle, or <em>Last In, First Out</em>. 
            This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first one removed, similar to a stack of plates 
            where you add plates on top and remove them from the top.

        <h2>Basic Stack Operations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Push:</strong> Adds an element to the top of the stack.</li>
            <li><strong>Pop:</strong> Removes the top element from the stack.</li>
            <li><strong>Peek (or Top):</strong> Retrieves the top element without removing it.</li>
            <li><strong>IsEmpty:</strong> Checks if the stack has no elements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Characteristics of a Stack</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>LIFO (Last In, First Out):</strong> The last element added is the first one removed.</li>
            <li><strong>Single Access Point:</strong> All operations are performed at one end, known as the "top" of the stack.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Applications of Stacks</h2>
        <p>
            Stacks are commonly used in various applications due to their LIFO nature:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Function Call Management:</strong> Stacks manage function calls and return points in programming.</li>
            <li><strong>Expression Evaluation:</strong> They help in evaluating expressions, particularly in compilers.</li>
            <li><strong>Undo Mechanism:</strong> Applications use stacks to store actions, allowing users to undo them.</li>
            <li><strong>Navigation History:</strong> Browsers use stacks to manage the history of visited pages.</li>
        </ul>
