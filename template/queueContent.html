        <h2>What is a Queue?</h2>
        <p>
            In computer science, a <strong>Queue</strong> is a linear data structure that follows the <strong>FIFO</strong> 
            principle, or <em>First In, First Out</em>. This means that the first item added to the queue will be the 
            first one removed. You can think of a queue as a line at a ticket counter: people join at the end and leave 
            from the front.
        </p>

        <h2>Basic Queue Operations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Enqueue:</strong> Adds an element to the end of the queue.</li>
            <li><strong>Dequeue:</strong> Removes the element from the front of the queue.</li>
            <li><strong>Front:</strong> Retrieves the element at the front without removing it.</li>
            <li><strong>IsEmpty:</strong> Checks if the queue has no elements.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Key Characteristics of a Queue</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>FIFO (First In, First Out):</strong> The first element added is the first one removed.</li>
            <li><strong>Two Access Points:</strong> Elements are added at the rear (end) and removed from the front.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Applications of Queues</h2>
        <p>
            Queues are widely used in various applications due to their FIFO structure:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scheduling Tasks:</strong> Queues manage processes in CPU scheduling, where tasks are completed in the order they arrive.</li>
            <li><strong>Printer Queue:</strong> In a printing system, jobs are processed in the order they're added.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Buffers:</strong> Queues are used in buffering data for streaming, where data arrives in a sequence.</li>
            <li><strong>Breadth-First Search (BFS):</strong> In graph algorithms, BFS uses queues to explore nodes in levels.</li>
        </ul>
