        <h1>Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms</h1>
        <p>
            Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are fundamental concepts in computer science. 
            They are essential for organizing, managing, and storing data efficiently, which helps in solving problems effectively. 
            A solid understanding of DSA improves the performance and efficiency of software solutions.
        </p>
        
        <h2>What is a Data Structure?</h2>
        <p>
            A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. 
            Data structures define the layout of data in memory and provide ways to manage data for optimal use.
        </p>
        <h3>Common Types of Data Structures</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Arrays:</strong> A collection of elements identified by index or key.</li>
            <li><strong>Linked Lists:</strong> A linear collection of elements where each element points to the next.</li>
            <li><strong>Stacks:</strong> A LIFO (Last In, First Out) structure used for temporary storage.</li>
            <li><strong>Queues:</strong> A FIFO (First In, First Out) structure used for ordered data processing.</li>
            <li><strong>Trees:</strong> A hierarchical data structure with nodes connected by edges, commonly used in searching.</li>
            <li><strong>Graphs:</strong> A network of nodes connected by edges, useful in modeling relationships.</li>
            <li><strong>Hash Tables:</strong> A data structure that stores data in key-value pairs for quick access.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What is an Algorithm?</h2>
        <p>
            An algorithm is a step-by-step set of instructions designed to solve a specific problem or perform a computation.
            Algorithms are designed for efficiency and clarity, ensuring tasks are completed in a minimal amount of time.
        </p>
        <h3>Key Properties of Algorithms</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Correctness:</strong> The algorithm should solve the problem accurately.</li>
            <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> The algorithm should use resources optimally (e.g., time and memory).</li>
            <li><strong>Finiteness:</strong> The algorithm should have a clear stopping point.</li>
            <li><strong>Determinism:</strong> Each step in the algorithm should be unambiguous.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Types of Algorithms</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sorting Algorithms:</strong> Used to arrange data in a particular order (e.g., Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort).</li>
            <li><strong>Searching Algorithms:</strong> Used to find specific data in a structure (e.g., Binary Search, Linear Search).</li>
            <li><strong>Graph Algorithms:</strong> Used for traversing and analyzing graph structures (e.g., Dijkstra's Algorithm, DFS, BFS).</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Programming:</strong> Used for optimizing solutions by storing intermediate results (e.g., Fibonacci Series).</li>
            <li><strong>Greedy Algorithms:</strong> Used for finding an optimal solution by choosing the best choice at each step (e.g., Prim's, Kruskal's).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Study Data Structures and Algorithms?</h2>
        <p>
            Learning Data Structures and Algorithms provides a foundation for solving complex problems effectively. 
            It helps in building efficient and optimized software applications and is essential in competitive programming and technical job interviews.
        </p>
        <p>
            By mastering DSA, programmers can improve their logical thinking and develop solutions that run faster and consume fewer resources.
